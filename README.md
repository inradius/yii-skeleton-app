Yii Framework Skeleton App
======================
This is a generic Yii Framework application with MySQL integration. I built this simple app as the starting point for many projects I have worked on in the past. This application allows for user registration, user sign-in and sign-out, Facebook/Google+/Windows Live sign-in, and password reset.

This skeleton application does not include the Yii Framework itself. Download it [here](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii/).
